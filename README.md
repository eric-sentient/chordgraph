# chordgraph
a graph based procedural generator for chord progressions

about what it sounds like. I'm currently using a custom JDK provided by my university's data structures course which includes libraries for directed graphs and other useful things. Unfortunately, that means chordGraph probably won't compile on your computer at the moment.
